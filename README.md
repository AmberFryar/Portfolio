# Portfolio Website

https://AmberFryar.netlify.app

## Overview
A minimalist web design allows viewers to learn about me and my experience and view projects.
## Technologies and Software
Vue3, VS Code, Javascript, Procreate, deployed on Netlify
## Features
- Responsive Web Design: Viewers can effectively view the website on different screen sizes. Media screen limits trigger changes to the layout and image proportions.
- Dropdown Menu: When viewed on a mobile device, the banner on the subpages converts to a dropdown menu to reduce the visual clutter.
- Favicon links: Icons redirect to social media sites directly.
- Art: I used Procreate to design and draw the website art.
## Project Takeaways
- Although this is a small project, I made it a priority to learn how to be protective of my code. I focused on initially creating and merging branches so that my main branch was never at risk. Backward planning would have been very effective for this project. I had a few ideas of what I wanted the website to look and feel like but I began to code too soon. If I were to take a fresh approach to this project, I would have drawn up a few options of wireframes, committed to a design, and then began to code.  
## What's next
- I am continuing to build out the project page. Currently, it links directly to Github. In the near future, it will open a new page with screenshots, an overview, and links to the specific GitHub repository.
