  <p id = "firstParagraph"> I love processes, projects, problem-solving, people, plants, pets, and apparently alliterations.
    I recently completed Tech Elevator’s remote full-stack development boot camp. Prior to that accomplishment I earned
    my B.S. in Biological Sciences and obtained a secondary education license. With those credentials in hand,
    I returned to the place that most adults have tried to remove from memory- middle school.
    It was as much of a ride as an adult as it was as an adolescent.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Walking away from teaching not only left me with many stories but also the confidence and excitement for my newfound
    path.
    My time as a teacher helped me discover that my passion and talents lie in problem-solving, finding inefficiencies,
    and creating new systems. My colleagues always said they taught for that light bulb moment when the student finally
    gets it.
    That was their fuel. I realized that my fuel was seeing the positive results of deploying new or updated systems and
    curricula.
    Training to be a software developer lets me merge my passion for process improvement with my progressing technical
    skills.
    Collaborating with a team to create technical solutions is my fuel. </p>
  <br>
  <p>While I am AFK-ing (as the cool kids say), I can be found volunteering for the local cat rescue,
    reading Harry Potter (I’m a millennial- what more can I say?), battling my family in Catan,
    planning and completing home renovations projects, trying to keep my house plants alive or hiking in the mountains.
    I don’t know if I am more excited to ride my new 1980 Honda Trail 110 in the mountains or replace the 1968 harvest
    gold bathroom fixtures this year.</p><br>
